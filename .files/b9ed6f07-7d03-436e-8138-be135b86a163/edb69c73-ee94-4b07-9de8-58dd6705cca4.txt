Seasonality

Rides

We typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Rides in the first quarter.

Eats

We expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Eats has masked these seasonal fluctuations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 26,900 employees.
